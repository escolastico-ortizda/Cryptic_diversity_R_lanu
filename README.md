# Population genetic structure and clonal analyses of _Racomitrium lanuginosum_ in the forest-tundra transition zone.

## 1. Overview
This repository contains the scripts and dataset related to the project “Hide-and-seek in the tundra: Accounting for cryptic species uncovers molecular variation in moss clonal populations”. The main goal of the code is to provide detailed information on the project/article analyses (reproducibility). 

## 2. Software information
The code was run on a bioinformatic server using preinstalled software and on the statistic environment R. Please check each script for details.

## 3. Data availability
The sequence data is available on the Sequence Read Archive repository (NCBI) under the BioProject PRJNA1023519. The sequence accession numbers for the samples include SRR26265052 to SRR26265159. Previously published sequences can be retrieved from the [BioProject PRJNA735773](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA735773).

Files used for analyses are provided in the dataset folder.

Reference-based alignments were performed using two transcriptomes of _R. elongatum_ Ehrh. ex Frisvoll [(ID: ABCD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104170995/) and _R. varium_ (Mitt.) A.Jaeger [(ID: RDOO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/?term=Racomitrium+varium) (Carpenter et al., 2019; Leebens-Mack et al., 2019).

Be aware that the code may contain issues related to updated software or packages and IS NOT intended to serve as an optimized pipeline but as supplementary information for the research.
